### Introduction

This katacoda covers the import and evaluation of csv data with Neo4j.

We will learn the basics of CSV handling alongside a short example. After installing and starting Neo4j as an instance in a docker container we take a look at the given data.
The [data used](https://www.kaggle.com/mlomuscio/fear-pilot) contains results of a pilot study related to fears of individuals in the US.
After analyzing the structure of the given data we create a simple model in Neo4j representing the given data.
As last step a simple query will be created and run to give an example of how to analyze the data.

While working the example short comments about the data and Neo4j are given. For more information the [https://neo4j.com](official Neo4j website) is a great place to start.
